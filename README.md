# !!! WARNING !!! - Chaos ensues

# olc Code Jam 2019 - Theme: Destruction

I mainly use this code jam to get my gears going again, after a while of 
not writing any code. I neither have a lot of spare time during this jam,
nor do I have a clear goal or expectation for the final entry.

I wanted to get more familiar with ``vim`` and ``git``, having started to
use the former only recently and being more used to writing code in IDEs,
 I also feel I don't really know how to use the latter properly. So the
result of this week of coding will be secondary to improving my skills
over all.

More information when I have an idea of what I'll be doing...
